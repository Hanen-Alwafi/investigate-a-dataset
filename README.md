Investigate a Dataset for N0_show patients appointment

In this project I well investigate why the patient do not show to the appointment. what the reason behind missing the appointment.


The results:
people who are aged between 20 and 50 more likely to not showed to the appointment.
the number of people who did not receive SMS and came to appotiment is 60290, and who came to appointment and received SMS is 25017. Therefore, people who received SMS are more likley to come to the appointment.
We can tell that the number of female are more than male therefore it is not consider as factoer in our reaserch
